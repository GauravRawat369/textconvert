React Project
=============

Welcome to my first React project! In this project, I have built a basic React application using components and props. I have also implemented Hooks and dark and light modes.

🚀 About Me
-----------

I'm a second-year student studying in Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology.

💻 Technologies Used
--------------------

I have used the following technologies to build this project:

-   React
-   JSX
-   Components and Props
-   Hooks
-   Dark and Light Modes

🎨 UI Design
------------

I have designed a simple and clean user interface for this project. The UI supports both dark and light modes.

🚀 Features
-----------

-   Made a basic JSX structure and used components and props.
-   Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces and think about each piece in isolation. You can find a detailed component API reference [here](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html).
-   Implemented Hooks.
-   Used `useState` to declare the default state of components.
-   Implemented dark and light modes.

🙏 Acknowledgements
-------------------

I would like to thank the React team for creating such an amazing library and providing extensive documentation. I would also like to thank my mentors and peers for their support and guidance throughout my learning journey.
